Eleven population-level effect estimation analysis variants were defined.

<h4>Time-at-risk</h4>

Time-at-risk periods were specified dependent on the outcome:

<ul>
<li>VTE, infection, readmission, and mortality primary time-at-risk definition: the duration of time from the index date (day 0, inclusive) to 60 days after the index date.</li>
<li>VTE, infection, readmission, and mortality sensitivity time-at-risk definitions: the duration of time from the index date (day 0, inclusive) to 1 year after the index date and 5 years after the index date.</li>
<li>Opioid use primary time-at-risk definition: the duration of time from 91 days after index date to 1 year after the index date.</li>
<li>Opioid use sensitivity time-at-risk definition: the duration of time from 91 days after index date to 5 years after the index date.</li>
<li>Knee arthroplasty revision primary time-at-risk definition: the duration of time from the index date (day 0, inclusive) to 5 years after the index date.</li>
<li>Knee arthroplasty revision sensitivity time-at-risk definition: the duration of time from the index date (day 0, inclusive) to 1 year after the index date.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Propensity score matching</h4>

Propensity score matching approaches varied the matching ratio and trimming proportion.

<ul>
<li>Matching ratio primary approach: variable-ratio matching which assigned unicompartmental to total knee arthroplasty patients in a maximum ratio of 10:1 using 0.2 caliper on the standardized logit scale of the propensity score.</li>
<li>Matching ratio sensitivity approach: assigned unicompartmental to total knee arthroplasty patients in a 1:1 using 0.2 caliper on the standardized logit scale of the propensity score.</li>
<li>Trimming proportion primary approach: Trim extremes of the propensity score distribution by 0%</li>
<li>Trimming proportion sensitivity approach: Trim extremes of the propensity score distribution by 5%</li>
</ul>
