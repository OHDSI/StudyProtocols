Two target cohorts were constructed for population-level effect estimation. Full codeset specifications are available in the study protocol.

<h4>1.	Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty</h4>

<h5>Non-technical summary:</h5>
The first unicompartmental knee arthroplasty procedure was considered the event of interest with the date of the surgery as the patient's index date. Inclusion criteria required patients to have at least 1 year of continuous pre-index recordeddatabase observation time. We excluded patients using published exclusion/ eligibility eligibility criteria of the TOPKAT trial: individuals below the age of 40, and prior evidence of knee arthroplasty, knee fracture, knee surgery except diagnostic procedures, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies, and  septic arthritis at any time before the index date. Patients with  spine, hip, or foot pathology observed in the 365 days before index date were also excluded.

<h4>2.	Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty without hip-spine-foot pathology restriction</h4>

<h5>Non-technical summary:</h5>

Inclusion criteria required patients to have at least 1 year of continuous pre-index recordeddatabase observation time. We excluded patients using published exclusion/ eligibility eligibility criteria of the TOPKAT trial: individuals below the age of 40, and prior evidence of knee arthroplasty, knee fracture, knee surgery except diagnostic procedures, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies, and  septic arthritis at any time before the index date.
