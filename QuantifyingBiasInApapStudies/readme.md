**Purpose**: To quantify bias in observational study designs used to study the relationship between acetaminophen and cancer.

**Methods**:  To mimic these study designs including several variants of the case-control design and a cohort design, while including negative control outcomes (outcomes known not to be caused by acetaminophen) in addition to several cancer outcomes.

**Analysis**: We will assess to what extent these study designs produce estimates for the negative controls in line with the truth (that there is no effect), and to what extent the estimates for the cancer outcomes are distinguishable from those for the negative controls.
