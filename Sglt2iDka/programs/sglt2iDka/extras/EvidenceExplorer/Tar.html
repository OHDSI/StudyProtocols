<p>Two time-at-risk definitions were applied.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent-to-Treat:</strong> The primary time-at-risk definition is the intent-to-treat period, defined as the time from 1 day after the first exposure to the cohort-defining antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) to all days until an incident DKA diagnosis or the end of the patient's observation period (disenrollment or the end of database coverage), whichever came first.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Protocol:</strong> The secondary time-at-risk is the per-protocol period, in which time-at-risk was censored by the end of a persistent period of cohort-defining drug exposure or the start of a drug era for another drug under study that is other than the cohort-defining drug. The end date of a persistent drug exposure is the date when the patient is expected to finish the supply of the last drug dispensing per the prescription information. A 90 day gap is allowed between successive exposures until the final dispensing record. </li>
</ul>
