<p>We will apply two time-at-risk definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The primary time-at-risk definition will be an '<strong>intent-to-treat</strong>' (ITT) period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) to all days from exposure cohort start date, which will be the end of the patient's observation period for which the exposure cohort start date occurred.</li>
<li>The secondary time-at-risk will be defined as the '<strong>per-protocol</strong>' period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) to 0 days from exposure cohort end date, where exposure cohort end date was defined as the persistent period of exposure, allowing for 90 day gap between successive exposures until the final exposure record, representing the date the subject expected to finish the supply of the last drug dispensing per the prescription information. The exposure cohort end date may be censored by the start of a drug era for another of the drugs under study other than the cohort-defining drug.</li>
</ol>
<p>
For all analyses, a qualifying person from an exposure cohort will contribute time-at-risk from the time-at-risk start date until some censoring event occurs. For the 'intent-to-treat' and 'per-protocol' analyses, time-at-risk start date is defined as the date of first exposure to the particular drug(s) in the database, where the exposure start is between 1April2013 and 31Dec2017. For the 'intent-to-treat' period, the censoring event is the observation period end date. In all circumstances, a patient is not censored by experiencing hospitalization for other reasons.  For the 'per-protocol' period, the censoring event is the earliest of: 1) exposure cohort end date, as defined by the end of persistent period of exposure censored at the time of a drug era start for another of the drugs under study other than the cohort-defining drug, and 2) observation period end date (which is defined by end of continuous insurance eligibility or death).</p>
